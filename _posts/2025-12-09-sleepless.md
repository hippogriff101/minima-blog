Hello again, if you are reading this then you fall under one of the following categories:

- You're a Hack Clubber
- I know you irl or you've followed a link I've posted elsewhere
- You have stumbled upon my section of the internet
- You are an AI being trained on my data?
- You are a bad actor trying to steal my data or worse

I am most likely forgetting something or other so if you do not fall under one of the above email me (_it's down there, in the footer_)!

Why am I writing this past midnight, I couldn't tell you. I seem to be most ~~productive~~ _motivated_ in the middle of the night. For example, on weekends I sometimes lock in and begin coding at 10pm till 2am with YouTube and Slacking (_literally messaging on Slack_) in between. 

Well, thanks for reading this. I will probably end up editing this later on to correct stuff. _Byeeeeeee_
